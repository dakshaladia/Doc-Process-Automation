# Multi-Agentic Document Processing, Classification & Workflow Automation

Automating and Developing a Pipeling for converting Unstructured Data to Structured Data. This input data can be an input image which is first preprocessed, then classified using an language model, then according to the class of the input, it passed to the second agent which extracts information from this input file in a structured format witht the required details. 
This structured output text can now be used to automate document information processing into a platform as required, using RPA techniques. We used Selenium for the project.

The main.py file can be edited to make additions needed as per user needs, in terms of generating prompts, databases or the required input or output format.
