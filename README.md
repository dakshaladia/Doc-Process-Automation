# Multi-Agentic Document Processing, Classification & Workflow Automation

Developing an automation pipeline for converting Unstructured Data to Structured Data and post processing workflow automation. This input data can be an input image which is first preprocessed, then classified using an language model, then according to the class of the input, it passed to the second agent which extracts information from this input file in a structured format with the required details. 
This structured output text is now used to automate document information processing into a platform as required, using RPA techniques. We used Selenium for the project.

The main.py file can be edited to make additions needed as per user needs, in terms of generating prompts, databases or the required input or output format.

[the software was built and sold to a company, hence only a basic code framework is present in the repository and not the complete software]
